# Quick Renderbuttons for Blender 2.9
This addon creates three buttons for easier access to the render and playblast operators in Blender and DuBlast

This addon is essentially a combination of the two addons "Camera Manager" (https://blender-addons.org/camera-manager/) and DuBlast (https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuBLF_DuBlast). It uses the core parts of Camera Manager and nearly the full code of DuBlast to add 3 Buttons to the Render settings tab. They bring back the functionality of the old Render buttons in Blender 2.7, but replaces the "Render to audio" button with DuBlast's playblast script.

Warning: Because DuBlast is almost unchanged in this addon, it is currently not compatible with the original DuBlast addon (Technically both might work at the same time, but you will encounter errors when removing or adding either of them).
