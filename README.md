# Quick Renderbuttons for Blender 3.0
This addon creates three buttons for easier UI access to the rendering operators in Blender.

It adds three Buttons to the "Properties -> Render" tab. 

The third button will only be visible if DuBlast is installed (https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuBLF_DuBlast) and starts rendering and playing a playblast video (DuBlast saves the video file to your output directory).
