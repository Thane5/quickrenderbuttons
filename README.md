# Quick Renderbuttons for Blender 2.9
This addon creates three buttons for easier acces to the render and playblast operators in blender and DuBlast

Warning: This addon is based on DuBlast (https://github.com/Rainbox-dev/DuBLF_DuBlast) and is currently not currently compatible with it. 
The button code is derived from camera manager: https://blender-addons.org/camera-manager/
